# PINCH
The main goal of this mini project

## 1: Pinch & Zoom App ##
Create advanced Pinch and Zoom features with SwiftUI gestures
## 2: SwiftUI Gestures ##
Get familiar with almost every SwiftUI gesture such as long-press gesture, double-tap gesture, drag gesture,
and magnification gesture (a gesture that recognizes a magnification motion and tracks the amount of it).
## 3: SwiftUI Materials ##
Apply a blur effect (with color vibrancy) to a view that appears behind another view by adding a material with the background modifier. The new SwiftUI material is not a view,
but adding material is like inserting a translucent layer between the modified view and its background.
## 4: SF Symbols ##
With over 3200 icons, SF Symbols is a library of iconography designed to integrate seamlessly with San Francisco, the system font for Apple platforms.
